FoundryTools-CLI documentation
=================================
FoundryTools-CLI is a command line interface for the FoundryTools library, which
provides a set of tools for working with font files. It is designed to be used
from the command line, allowing users to perform various operations on font
files without the need for a graphical user interface.

The CLI provides a range of commands for manipulating font files, including
converting between different font formats, extracting and modifying font
metadata, and performing various font-related operations. It is built on top of
the FoundryTools library, which provides a comprehensive set of tools for
working with font files in Python.

The CLI is designed to be easy to use and provides a consistent interface for
working with different font formats. It is suitable for both developers and
font designers who need to perform various operations on font files from the
command line. The CLI is also extensible, allowing users to add their own
commands and functionality as needed.
